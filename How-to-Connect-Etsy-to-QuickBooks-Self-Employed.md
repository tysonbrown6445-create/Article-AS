Step-by-Step: How to Connect Etsy to QuickBooks Self-Employed
-------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 1: Log in to QuickBooks Self-Employed

Visit the official site and sign in using QuickBooks Self-Employed Online Login with your Intuit credentials.

### Step 2: Connect Your Bank Account

QuickBooks Self-Employed does not directly integrate with Etsy. Instead, it pulls data from the bank account linked to Etsy Payments.

*   Go to **Settings → Bank Accounts**
    
*   Select your bank
    
*   Connect the account that Etsy deposits funds into
    

This method ensures sales, fees, and payouts sync automatically.

### Step 3: Review Imported Etsy Transactions

Once connected, QuickBooks Self-Employed will import:

*   Etsy payouts
    
*   Transaction fees
    
*   Shipping charges
    
*   Refunds
    

Categorize each transaction correctly to keep reports accurate.

### Step 4: Categorize Etsy Income & Fees

*   Mark sales as Business Income
    
*   Categorize Etsy fees as Advertising or Marketplace Fees
    
*   Shipping labels can be marked as Shipping Expense
    

If you’re unsure how to classify certain transactions, consulting a certified [QuickBooks ProAdvisor](https://www.wizxpert.com/find-a-quickbooks-proadvisor/) can prevent costly bookkeeping mistakes.

How to Track Etsy Sales Tax in QuickBooks Self-Employed
-------------------------------------------------------

Etsy often collects and remits sales tax automatically in many regions. These amounts may appear in deposits but shouldn’t be counted as income.

Best practice:

*   Split the transaction
    
*   Mark the tax portion as Sales Tax (Non-Income)

Common Problems When Connecting Etsy to QuickBooks Self-Employed
----------------------------------------------------------------

### Etsy Income Looks Lower Than Expected

This usually happens because:

*   Etsy fees are deducted before payout
    
*   Taxes are included in gross amounts
    

Review individual transactions to confirm accuracy.

### Missing Etsy Transactions

Try the following:

*   Refresh bank connection
    
*   Check date filters
